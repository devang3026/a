                What is Squat ??

                    <item>T</item>he squat is considered a compound movement, meaning it works multiple muscle groups
                    across multiple joints. The primary muscles involved in the movement are your quadriceps (the
                    muscles in the front of your thighs) and your glutes (your butt muscles), Tamir says. On the
                    eccentric part of the move, or the lowering portion of the squat, the muscles in your hamstrings and
                    your hip flexors fire too.

                    Before you start adding weight, you want to get the squat motion down with bodyweight squats first.
                    Form is key, since performing squats properly can cut down the risk of injury during the move.

                    Here’s what you need to know about doing squats correctly, and how you can avoid some common
                    squatting mistakes.
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                    <b>Assume the squat stance.</b> – Before you squat, you should get in proper squat position: Keep
                    your feet about shoulder-width apart, Tamir says. There’s no set rule for exact positioning of your
                    feet—it’ll vary depending upon anatomical differences—but a good guideline is for them to turn out
                    anywhere between 5 and 30 degrees. So rather than pointing straight ahead, your feet will turn out
                    slightly, but how much they do will depend on your particular comfort level and mobility.
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                    <b> Screw your feet into the floor </b>– Dialing your feet into the ground helps engage your
                    muscles, improve alignment, and create stability with the ground, says Tamir. It’ll also help keep
                    your arches from collapsing, which can make your knees more likely to cave inward when you squat.
                    (This is what’s known as knee valgus.)
